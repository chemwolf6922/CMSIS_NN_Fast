This implementation of CMSIS-NN solved the painfully slow memory copy problem in normal convolution layers and especially depthwise convolution layers. This optimization achieves 2X inference speed for DS-CNN models running on cortex m4 processors.
Please replace the functions in the original CMSIS-NN model and please notice the changes made to the parameters.
More is on the way. A fully automatic Tensorflow to cortex-m4 toolchain for DS-CNN models will be released if my company allows me to do so.
